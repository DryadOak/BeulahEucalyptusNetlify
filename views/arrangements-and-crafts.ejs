                                Our floral displays are unique artworks made to honour
                                your occasion. These pieces do require advance notice
                                particularly if you would like inorganic materials,
                                specialist blooms, or a complex design. Our quotes are
                                based on minimum wage and offcuts; larger budgets allow
                                for a more intricate piece.

                                For wearing, display or memorial. Depth of texture and
                                colour are built up from seasonal flora on a handwoven
                                wooden frame. Wreaths are made to connect us to the
                                cycle of seasons or can be personalised tributes of
                                celebration or grief. A simple, foliage filled circlet
                                starts at Â£30, but do get in touch if you have something
                                in mind.
