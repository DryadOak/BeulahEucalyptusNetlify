                        Varying Foliage Quality: As natural products, foliage quality will

                        eucalyptus is exposed to the Dartmoor weather and its animals and
                        insects, so seasonal variance is to be expected. Sometime minor
                        marks on the leaves or wiggly branches. Additionally, please
                        understand that natural variations in colour, shape, and size may
                        occur. Such variations are not considered defects and will not
                        qualify for refunds or exchanges unless they significantly deviate
                        from our product descriptions.
